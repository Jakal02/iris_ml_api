# Backend for Iris Model

FastAPI backend to serve the iris model.


I chose to use Poetry to create this API, as this is a more proper python application, and not an experimentation zone.

Poetry is really popular for project management because it's easy to track packages added, their dependencies, and dependency resolution works much faster.

[Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to your system. This is the python package and dependency manager used for this project.

Once installed to your system, install the dependencies by first navigating /backend/ which contains pyproject.toml. Then run:


```bash
poetry install --with dev
```
